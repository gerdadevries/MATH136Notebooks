    "# Partial Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we extend the concept of the derivative of a function of one variable to partial derivatives for functions of several variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the derivative of a function of one variable, $y=f(x)$, represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For functions of several variables, we can measure rates of change in the direction of each of the independent variables.  These are called <i>partial derivatives</i>.  Many of the ideas about derivatives carry over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Partial Derivatives for Functions of Two Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function $z=f(x,y)$.  Suppose we keep $y=b$ fixed.  In that case, we essentially obtain a function of a single variable, $x$, namely $g(x) = f(x,b)$.  By definition, the derivative of $g(x)$ at $x=a$ is \n",
    "$$g'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ g(a+h) - g(a) }{ h }.$$\n",
    "Introducing the notation $f_x$ to denote the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$, we thus have \n",
    "$$f_x(a,b) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(a+h,b) - f(a,b) }{ h }.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, using $f_y$ to denote the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$, we have \n",
    "$$f_y(a,b) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(a,b+h) - f(a,b) }{ h }.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing (by letting $a$ and $b$ vary), we have \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_x(x,y) & = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x+h,y) - f(x,y) }{ h }, \\\\\n",
    "f_y(x,y) & = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x,y+h) - f(x,y) }{ h }.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "These definitions suggest the following practical approach to determining partial derivatives of $z=f(x,y)$:\n",
    "- To determine $f_x$, treat $y$ as a constant, and differentiate with respect to $x$. \n",
    "- To determine $f_y$, treat $x$ as a constant, and differentiate with respect to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example 1:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $f(x,y) = 3 - x^3 - y^2$.  Determine $f_x(1,1)$ and $f_y(1,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Treating $y$ as a constant, and differentiating with respect to $x$ gives\n",
    "$$f_x(x,y) = 0 - 3x^2 - 0 = -3x^2,$$\n",
    "and so $f_x(1,1) = -3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Treating $x$ as a constant, and differentiating with respect to $y$ gives\n",
    "$$f_y(x,y) = 0 - 0 - 2y = -2y,$$\n",
    "and so $f_y(1,1) = -2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Those readers wishing to see the above example (and all following examples) worked out in a video are referred to Section 6 below.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Partial Derivatives: Additional Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative notation is similar to Leibniz notation, but using the symbol $\\partial$ instead of $d$.  If $z = f(x,y)$, we can write \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_x(x,y) & = f_x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}, \\\\ \n",
    "f_y(x,y) & = f_y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example 2:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $f(x,y) = \\sin(xy^2)$.  Determine $f_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Treating $y$ as a constant, and differentiating with respect to $x$ (keeping the chain rule in mind) gives\n",

    "& = \\cos(xy^2) \\cdot y^2 \\\\\n",
    "& = y^2 \\cos(xy^2).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "> Treating $x$ as a constant, and differentiating with respect to $y$ (keeping the chain rule in mind) gives\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_y(x,y) \n",
    "& = \\cos(xy^2) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (xy^2) \\\\\n",
    "& = \\cos(xy^2) \\cdot x \\cdot 2y \\\\\n",
    "& = 2 xy \\cos(xy^2).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example 3:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $f(x,y) = e^{xy} (x^2 + y^2)$.  Determine $f_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Treating $y$ as a constant, and differentiating with respect to $x$ (keeping the product rule and the chain rule in mind) gives\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_x(x,y) \n",

    "& = y(x^2+y^2)e^{xy} + 2xe^{xy}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similarly (try it yourself!), we have \n",
    "$$f_y(x,y) = x(x^2+y^2)e^{xy} + 2ye^{xy}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Checking Your Work: Partial Differentiation with Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "On WolframAlpha, you can simply use the `differentiate` command, but you need to indicate with respect to which variable you want to differentiate, for example `differentiate sin(xy^2) with respect to x`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Partial Derivatives of Functions of More Than Two Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the partial derivative extends naturally to functions of more than two variables.  Formally, for a function of $n$ variables, $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, we have \n",
    "$$f_{x_i} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} = \n",
    "\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x_1, \\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_i + h, x_{i+1}, \\ldots, x_n) - f(x_1, \\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}, \\ldots, x_n) }{h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to determine $f_{x_i}$, treat $x_1, \\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\ldots, x_n$ as constants, and differentiate with respect to $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example 4:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $f(x,y,z) = \\ln(xyz^2)$.  Determine $f_x$ and $f_z$. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Treating $y$ and $z$ as constants, and differentiating with respect to $x$ gives\n",
    "$$f_x(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{xyz^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xyz^2) = \\frac{yz^2}{xyz^2}.$$\n",

    "$$f_z(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{xyz^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(xyz^2) = \\frac{2xyz}{xyz^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Higher-Order Partial Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for $z=f(x,y)$, the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ also are functions of $x$ and $y$.  We can differentiate each of these functions with respect to $x$ and $y$ to obtain $(f_x)_x$, $(f_x)_y$, $(f_y)_x$, and $(f_y)_y$.  We introduce the following notation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "(f_x)_x & = f_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2}, \\\\\n",
    "(f_x)_y & = f_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\ \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y \\ \\partial x}, \\\\\n",
    "(f_y)_x & = f_{yx} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\ \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x \\ \\partial y}, \\\\\n",
    "(f_y)_y & = f_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y^2}, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note the order of the subscript $xy$ and the order of $\\partial y \\ \\partial x$ in the denominator: $\\displaystyle f_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\ \\partial x}$ indicates differentiation with respect to $x$ first, followed by differentiation with respect to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, for well-behaved functions (where $f$, $f_x$, $f_y$, $f_{xy}$, and $f_{yx}$ all are continuous in the neighbourhood of the point $(a,b)$), the mixed derivatives are equal, that is,\n",
    "$$f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b),$$\n",
    "and the order of differentiation does not matter.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- For $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, the partial derivative $\\displaystyle f_{x_i} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}$ is obtained by treating $x_1, \\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\ldots, x_n$ as constants, and differentiating with respect to $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notation for partial derivatives of $z=f(x,y)$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_x(x,y) & = f_x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}, \\\\ \n",
    "f_y(x,y) & = f_y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notation for higher-order partial derivatives: <br>\n",
    "$\\displaystyle f_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\ \\partial x}$ indicates differentiation with respect to $x$ first, followed by differentiation with respect to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general (for continuous functions with continuous derivatives), the order of differentiation for higher-order partial derivatives does not matter.  For example, $f_{xxy} = f_{xyx} = f_{yxx}$.\n",
